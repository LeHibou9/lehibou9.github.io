# MLOps

I wrote this page to assess my comprehension of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). The main sources I follow are:
* [DeepLearning.ai's MLOps Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)
* [Introducing MLOps](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-mlops/9781492083283/)
* [ml-ops.org](https://www.ml-ops.org)

## What is MLOps?

MLOps is a set of principles and guidelines to ease the development of Machine Learning projects in enterprise. It is a quite new field and was created following the multiplication of big ML projects.

MLOps spans all the stages of a ML project: scoping, data, modelling and deployment.
